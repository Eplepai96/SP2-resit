# Clothing auction webpage

## Description
Clothing auction page, second attempt. Page is functional now, although not perfect. 

### Future updates
Page should have better error handling and display more descriptive messages to the user to improve ux. Some elements are out of line and styles should be updated accordingly. Not all design elements are implemented, implementation will lead to a more pleasing and comprehensive design.
